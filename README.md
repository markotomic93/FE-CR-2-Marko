(10 points) Add links to the menu that lead to other local HTML pages that you will additionally create for these bonus points and you are free to provide your design/layout solutions for these additional pages.

(05 points) Create a Media Query for tablets. For this option, as the tablet resolution is wider, two(2) columns should be able to fit in the screen.

NOTE: Bootstrap won't be accepted in this code review. It is important to follow the structure of the layout, including the placement of all elements. The cropping of the images, the font-size and font-family are not important.

Focus on how the articles are positioned in the 2 versions (for example: the 3 articles layout in the desktop vs. 1 article layout in the mobile version, as well as the disappearance of some images in the mobile version)
